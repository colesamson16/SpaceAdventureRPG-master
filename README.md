Description of game:

The year is 2100. Space exploration has advanced to the point where humans have now developed technology to help
them withstand the most extreme environments on neighbouring planets, which has led to the discovery of life on the planets. Intelligent life.

Migration between alien species and planets is now an ordinary system. But has led to tension between species.

This has led to the formation of the Space Exploration Extraterrestrial Division.
